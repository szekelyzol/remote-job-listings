# remote job listings

This is a collection of job boards specifically for remote IT jobs. I made this repo to collect info for friends who were recently laid off. **I'm not affiliated with any of these platforms**... yet? ðŸ«¥

I've *curated* the list on `2025-05-04`. This means I checked whether:

* the website works
* the jobs are kinda new, with the newest posted within a week

| **Website** | **Notes** |
|---|---|
| [Himalayas.app](https://himalayas.app/) | Mostly US-based remote only. |
