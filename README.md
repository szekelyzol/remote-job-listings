# remote job listings

This is a collection of job boards specifically for remote IT jobs. I made this repo to collect info for friends who were recently laid off. **I'm not affiliated with any of these platforms**. ðŸ«¥

I've *curated* the list on `2024-08-22`. This means I checked whether:

* the website works
* the jobs are kinda new, with the newest posted within a week

| **Website** | **Notes** |
|---|---|
| [Himalayas.app](https://himalayas.app/) | A large percentage of the jobs posted are US-based remote only. |
| [We Work Remotely](https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/search) | Well maintained and has LinkedIn integration. |
| [PowerToFly](https://powertofly.com/) | Sending applications requires an account. I did not try it! The board seems to be updated frequently, but I didn't really see any information on when positions are posted. |
| [RemoteHub](https://remotehub.io/remote-jobs/) | You have to Ctrl/âŒ˜ + f to search. |
| [Remotive](https://remotive.com/) | Looks well maintained. Also looks like they require an account before showing all postings. |
| [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) | Well maintained. |
| [Wellfound](https://wellfound.com/jobs) | They require an account before showing results. Companies are mostly US-based, but there is a nice filter for startups that hire remotely [here](https://wellfound.com/discover/startups?location=remote-friendly). They also have a weekly newsletter that lists recendly funded startups [here](https://wellfound.com/discover/blog/newsletters). Nice! |
| [No Fluff Jobs](https://nofluffjobs.com/) | All of the jobs posted are for central EU. |
| [Working Nomads](https://www.workingnomads.com/jobs) | Well maintained, has jobs posted on an hourly basis. |
| [Hidden Jobs](https://www.hidden-jobs.com/)  | Aggregates positions directly from company career pages. Updated daily. Scary amount of positions listed! |
